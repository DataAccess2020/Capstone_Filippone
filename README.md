# Capstone_Filippone

This capstone project aims at analyzing the communication of Italian politicians on Twitter.

More specifically, I tried to understand if there is a difference between left and right-wing politicians in terms of most recurring topics.

To do so, I performed a text analysis of their tweets using RStudio.
